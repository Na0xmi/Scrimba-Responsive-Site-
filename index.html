				<h3>Can humans win against the curses that are born by them? </h3>
				<p>There are always people who will criticize new manga coming out as mid for some reasons. JJK is no exception. Nevertheless I got quite hooked to the story, so much so that I devoured 8 bands in just 3 days. To grossly simplify the story it's all about curses that become too strong, and humans trying to reign them in. </p>
